# Hi there 👋 My name is Uygar. Thanks for being here!

I recently completed my studies at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/), sharpening my programming skills through rigorous, peer-to-peer, project-based learning, and I’m now looking for opportunities to contribute on a software team.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Maths and I am passionate about machine learning, data science, low-level programming, embedded systems, and recently, full-stack development. I mostly work in Python, the big four of web dev (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS), SQL, C/C++, and Assembly.

I’m currently leveling up my React skills through hands-on practice with [this complete React Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

My current GitHub commit ranking in Finland:

# What I've been cooking:

Here are some highlights from my projects that you can find here on GitHub:

* Web development projects:
    - A complete [Wordle clone](https://github.com/uygarpolat/wordle) with React.
    - A full-stack application where you can [play the legendary game, Pong](https://github.com/dbejar-s/ft_transcendence).
  	- [Webserv](https://github.com/cpireyre/webserv): HTTP/1.1 implementation in C++.
	- [Simple Todo App](https://github.com/uygarpolat/simple-todo-app): A simple web app to practice backend development.

* [LED PONG!](https://github.com/uygarpolat/LED-Pong): Built an Arduino-based Pong game, displayed on an LED Matrix and controlled via an app.
* I constantly try to improve my [data structures and algorithms](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php) proficiency in Python by:
	- Solving the [daily puzzle of Leetcode](https://github.com/uygarpolat/leetcode-daily), every day, no exceptions.
	- Completed the infamous [Neetcode 150](https://github.com/uygarpolat/neetcode-roadmap).
	- Finishing [The Advent of Code](https://github.com/uygarpolat/advent-of-code) every year, and retrospectively completing previous years (WIP).
