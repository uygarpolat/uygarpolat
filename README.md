# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Uygar Polat. Thanks for being here!

I am currently a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/), working on improving my programming skills.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Maths and I am passionate about machine learning, data science, low-level programming, and embedded systems. I mostly work in C, C++, Python, and Assembly, and I have extensive experience with Arduino microcontrollers. I am currently deep-diving deep learning in the context of PyTorch by taking the course [*A deep understanding of deep learning*](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning_x/).

My current Github commit ranking in Finland:

Here are some highlights from my projects that you can find here:

* [Libft](https://github.com/uygarpolat/libft): Recreated many of the C functions from scratch, using C.
* [Libasm](https://github.com/uygarpolat/libasm): Recreated many of the C functions from scratch, using x86_64 Assembly.
* [Minishell](https://github.com/uygarpolat/minishell): Created a simple Bash-like shell in C.
* Machine learning:
  	- [ft_linear_regression](https://github.com/uygarpolat/ft_linear_regression): A simple gradient descent implementation in Python.
  	- [PyTorch exercises](https://github.com/uygarpolat/pytorch-exercises): A repo for tracking my random PyTorch implemenations (WIP).
* [LED PONG!](https://github.com/uygarpolat/LED-Pong): Built an Arduino-based Pong game, displayed on an LED Matrix and controlled via an app.
* I constantly try to improve my [data structures and algorithms](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php) proficiency in Python by:
	- Solving the [daily puzzle of Leetcode](https://github.com/uygarpolat/leetcode-daily), every day, no exceptions.
	- Completed the infamous [Neetcode 150](https://github.com/uygarpolat/neetcode-roadmap).
	- Finishing [The Advent of Code](https://github.com/uygarpolat/advent-of-code) every year, and retrospectively completing previous years (WIP).
* Web development project:
  	- [Webserv](https://github.com/cpireyre/webserv): HTTP/1.1 implementation in C++.
  	- A basic [JSON web token (JWT) application](https://github.com/uygarpolat/simple-json-web-token).
* [DevOps with Docker](https://github.com/uygarpolat/devops-with-docker): My progress repo for following [The University of Helsinki's MOOC](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker).
* [MiniRT](https://github.com/cpireyre/miniRT): Created a raytracer in C.
* [Wordle](https://github.com/uygarpolat/ft_wordle): A wordle game you can play on terminal.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
